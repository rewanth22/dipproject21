# dipproject21
The following project has been implemented using python where we have done the operations of thresholding, contast, edge detection, watermarking, invisible watermarking and face detection. 
The first 4 were deployed on the internet using heroku on the website https://dipproject21.herokuapp.com/, while the latter two functionalites had large dependencies, they were implemented on the local host server,which is present in host.py.
